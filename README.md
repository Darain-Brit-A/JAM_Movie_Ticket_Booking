# 🎬 J.A.M Movie Ticket Booking System

A simple C program to book, view, and cancel movie tickets online. This console-based application simulates a movie ticket booking system with multiple movies, show timings, and payment options.

# 🏫 About This Project

We originally made this project in our first year as part of a C programming assessment. The program was initially written in C, and it helped us learn the basics of programming, handling inputs, and using functions.

Now, for ease of use and better accessibility, we have converted it into an HTML version.

It may not be perfect, but we created it while we were just introduced to C. After learning HTML, we re-implemented the same logic in a web-friendly format to make it easier to run and interact with.
